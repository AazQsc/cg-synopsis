# MATERIALS, SHADERS AND TEXTURES
- **Materials:** Materials determine how the surfaces of an object are rendered. The different material properties include color tones, transparency, reaction to light (matt or shiny), texture, and how it unfolds on an object, etc.  The properties of a material are determined by the shader it uses. 
- **Shaders:** Shaders are scripts that contain mathematical calculations and algorithms that allow determining the rendering of each object according to the lighting and the properties assigned to the equipment.  It is the shaders that determine the properties of materials.  
- **Texture:** Textures are bitmaps used by materials to give 3D objects their “graphic” appearance. Certain other types of textures (examples: normal map, height map, etc.) can also be used to determine other material properties (relief, reflectivity, roughness, etc.
