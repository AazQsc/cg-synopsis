The most important light settings:

POINT
- Light > Intensity
- Light > Source Radius (affects the softness of the shadows)
- Light > Temperature
- Light > Light Color
- Light > Indirect Lightning Intensity (reflected light)

SPOT
- Light > Inner Cone Angle
- Light > Outer Cone Angle

RECT
- Light > Barn Door Angle
- Light > Barn Door Length

DIRECTIONAL (solar light)
- Light > Source Angle (affects the softness of the shadows)

SKY
Captures the position of the sky and projects light from it onto our world.
For add sky 
1) click add -> Visual Effects -> Sky Atmosphere

How to enable LUMEN light:

In PostProcessVolume -->
Post Process Volume Settings -> Infinity Extent 'turn on'
Exposure -> Metering Mode -> Manual + Exposure Compensation 13.25 (the more the more blur)
Global Illumination -> Method 'Lumen'
Lumen Global Illumination -> Final Gather Quality (the more the less noise, affects performance)
Lumen Global Illumination -> Lumen Scene Detail (the more the finer details have shadows)

NOTES 

- Lightmass Settings: Static Lighting Level Scale * Indirect Lighting Quality = 1

- If the textures are low resolution, then the light on them will bake badly.
  Check it -> Optimization Viewmodes -> Lightmap Density -> click to textures -> Details -> Lighting -> Lightmass Settings -> Overriden Light Map Res
